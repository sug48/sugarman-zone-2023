Hi, I'm Michael Sugarman. I live in Providence, RI and work at the [Initiative for Digital Public Infrasturcture](publicinfrastructure.org) at UMass Amherst.

I perform and release music as [Sug](sugonline.bandcamp.com) and [Extestines](extestines.bandcamp.com).

This website is mainly for fun and hanging out. It's a work in progress, but what isn't?

You can look at my [CV](./src/static/Sugarman-CV-12-2022.pdf).
